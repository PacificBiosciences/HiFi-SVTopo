## Installation 
**This section is under construction**

The `cnidaria` Rust utility is available from the GitHub Releases page for Cnidaria. It requires no installation on Linux systems and can be directly invoked as described in the **Quick Start** section of [Cnidaria usage](docs/cnidaria_usage.md)


The `cnidaria_plotter` utility can be installed from Conda: `conda install -c bioconda cnidaria_plotter -y`. It is recommended that the installation be performed in a new Conda environment to avoid package interference.
